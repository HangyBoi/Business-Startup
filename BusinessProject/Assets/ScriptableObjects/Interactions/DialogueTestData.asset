  - My dear babushka! I'm glad God have protected you while I was away.
  - Sashen'ka, you are alive!
  - Do you remember the times when you and me used to play outside the village?
  - Your mama and papa helped me with the work but you always slacked off.
  - ' We had no dark winters, no famine or disease...'
  - ...
  - She came back to ruin that all we have..
  - ...
  - We must focus on the present and take revenge for the losses of our people.
  - Sashen'ka, you were always a strong little one, not so little anymore...
  - Mara.. She has been more.. intrusive so to speak.
  - The Forest is claimed by the children of Leshyi under her influence.
  - You should keep your distance, as their thorns may sting.
  - However, collecting them is necessary in order for us to keep this village safe
    from Mara's forces.
  - I will be careful. The family spirit will defend me from the evil.
  - ...
  - Wait-wait! I forgot, Auka may also be active in that area.
  - Try to.. surprise it! And stay safe, Sashen'ka.
